<p class="pcap"><i>The Blockhouse at Dayton, Oregon</i></p>
</div>
<p>This building was a military blockhouse built at the Grand
Ronde Indian Agency by Willamette Valley settlers in 1856. U. S.
Troops were sent to the station the same year and it was named
&ldquo;Fort Yamhill.&rdquo; Among the famous Army officers stationed at this
fort were Phil Sheridan, Joseph Wheeler, A. J. Smith, D. A. Russell,
and W. B. Hazen.</p>
<p>By permission of the U. S. Government, Fort Yamhill was
moved from Grand Ronde Agency to Dayton in 1911, through efforts
of John G. Lewis, a patriotic citizen. The structure was rebuilt
on this spot as a memorial to General Joel Palmer, a pioneer
of Oregon, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, founder of Dayton,
and donor of this park.</p>

<br /><i>Harvey E. Tobie, Ph.D., author of &ldquo;No Man Like Joe&rdquo;</i></h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s first sheriff and marshal, Colonel Joseph LaFayette
Meek, should be remembered, not so much as a witty adventurer,
a part much overplayed by writers, but as one of the very most
important&mdash;at times the most important&mdash;political leaders in this
northwest society. True, distance and lack of formal education
limited his contribution, especially to national developments. The
fact that his mother was a member of the important Walker family,
that his uncle Joseph married Jane Buchanan and that his cousin
Sarah Childress married James K. Polk might otherwise have opened
doors leading to distinction for a man of great natural ability and
winning personality.</p>
<p>There were twelve, or by one account, fifteen children in Meek&rsquo;s
Virginia family, too many for one man to educate in a day when
schooling was neither universal nor free. Joseph L. Meek chose to
go west. From his brother Hiram&rsquo;s home at Lexington, Missouri, he
enlisted in the fur trade in 1829 and continued that wild career for
eleven years. Decline of the fur trade forced him to move to Oregon
in 1840, driving one of the first wagons ever to reach the present
Oregon-Washington area.</p>
<p>The record summarized in the most definitive Meek biography,
<i>No Man Like Joe</i>, reveals not only a man with important ancestral
ties which he proudly and affectionately maintained, but the fond,
doting parent which he always was. Unlike many less responsible
trappers, he did not unfeelingly desert his Indian wife and his children,
but he took them along with him into the far west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Adjustment to family life in Oregon was somewhat difficult for
mountain people. It was 1842 before Joe had a field of wheat of
his own. Besides, his heavy involvement in public affairs interfered
with successful farming. Nevertheless, as shown by a letter written
to brother Hiram and republished so widely as to reach London,
he was a prosperous farmer by 1845. His north Tualatin plains
estate, consisting of 642.7 acres of combined prairie and timber land
of excellent quality, later became Donation Land Claim no. 61,
notification 122, Twp. 1 north, range 2 west. Here, in the autumn
of 1845, Joe hauled lumber from Oregon City by ox team and built
the first frame house in Twality County. The old log cabin was
made available to Uncle Ben Cornelius, his wife and nine children.</p>
<p>The boards used in the new house were probably one by twelves,
sixteen feet long, either set upright to form what was known as a
box house, or nailed lengthwise on a frame of hewn logs and poles
and covered by a shingled roof. This unpainted building was large
enough for a house-warming dance, but very inadequate according
to present standards. It was a one-story affair, with an attic, no
doubt, that could accommodate one or more sleepers. The effective
size of the front room was reduced by storage of saddles, pumpkins,
apples, and other produce. Thus, although the long kitchen was
adequate, the large and maturing family had little more than one-room
sleeping quarters. Used to better conditions in the east,
daughter Olive, after her return in the fall of 1862, promoted improvements.
Unbelievably, there was room for over-winter visits
of relatives.</p>
<p>The successive family houses on the original site no longer stand,
and the 1866 barn has been torn down. Fortunately, the home of
Mrs. Emma Ross Deardorff, in which she has lived since 1872, still
exhibits what are close similarities to the dwelling in which Colonel
Meek lived during his last years. Living on the original residential
site, now the Ernest Zurcher farm, are Mrs. Zurcher (Marjorie
Meek), her husband, and the grandchildren of Stephen A. D. Meek&mdash;the
great grandchildren of Joseph L. Meek.</p>
<p>There was a &ldquo;lost generation&rdquo; of Meeks. The Civil War and racial
discrimination in the years that followed were principally responsible
for the fact that marriages of all surviving Meek children were
delayed until later in life than is normal. The grandchildren of
Joseph L. Meek, who are now at the peak of their careers as average,
respected, useful citizens. Best known in Oregon is druggist J. Fred
Meek who is now, after another reelection, serving as representative
in the state legislature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We the undersigned agree to pay the sum annexed to our
names severally for the purpose of Erecting a house of worship; to
be the property of the West Union Baptist Church of Jesus Christ
our Lord and Saviour; said house to be built in Washington County
O. T., upon a lot of land furnished by David T. Lenox which the
said Lenox and wife secures to the church by lease as long as they
shall use it for a house of Worship, together with a burying ground,
the lot of land is on the east side of the Lenox land claim at a point
of timber adjoining the prairie, the house to be of good style frame
30 foot by 40 foot Square finished in good Style, the payments to
be made to the trustees, David T. Lenox, Henry Sewell and Reubin
W. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Thus reads a subscription paper dated April 20, 1853, which records
pledges of $749.70 toward the total cost of $1,512.43 of the
West Union Baptist Church. The average gift was $5.00 but David
T. Lenox heads the list with $200.00, his son, Edward, $60.00. Generous
pioneers of other faiths made contributions, including Dr.
John McLoughlin, D. H. Lounsdale, and James Failing.</p>
<p>On May 25, 1844, five Baptists met in the log house of David
Lenox on Tualatin Plains, about eight miles northwest of Hillsboro,
and constituted the first church of the Baptist denomination in Oregon.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Their Minute Book shows that they named their church the
West Union Baptist Church, decided to meet once each month at
the homes of members, and elected David T. Lenox temporary
Moderator. Subsequent entries clearly show that Lenox was the
leading member of this pioneer church.</p>
<p>He was born in New York State in 1801, lived in Illinois and
Missouri before leading a company of the 1843 wagon train to Oregon.
Lenox sent out the call in 1848 that resulted in the formation
of the Willamette Baptist Association. Although he was elected
Moderator and Deacon, Lenox was voted out of his church in November,
1862, but was reunited with it before his death in 1872.
His grave may be seen in the burying ground adjoining the white,
turreted church situated on his Donation Land Claim. The West
Union Baptist Church is the oldest Baptist Church west of the
Rocky Mountains and one of the oldest Protestant buildings still
standing in Oregon.</p>
<p>The Minute Book records the appointment of three committees
to locate a site for a Meeting House, but it was not until David
Lenox offered a portion of his land on April 9, 1855, that any progress
was made toward the erection of the church. The Reverend
Ezra Fisher, who was sent to Oregon by the American Baptist
Home Mission Board in 1845, delivered the sermon of dedication
on Christmas Day, 1853.</p>
<p>The West Union Baptist Church is the only pioneer church in
Oregon, measured, blueprinted, and photographed in the Historic
American Buildings survey in 1934. This project was carried out by
the Civil Works Administration in cooperation with the National
Parks Service of Plans and Designs within the Department of the
Interior throughout the United States. It was a depression measure
that offered employment to architects and secured records of great
value pertinent to early American architecture.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine districts for research were designated. Oregon and
Washington were &ldquo;District 39.&rdquo; The Oregon members of this district
committee were Walter Church, architect, Portland; Nellie B.
Pipes, librarian of the Oregon Historical Society, and W. R. B. Wilcox,
Dean of the Department of Architecture of the University of
Oregon. They employed twenty architects and two photographers.
On the closing date of the project, April 28, 1934, forty-seven structures
in Oregon and seven in Washington had been studied, delineated
and photographed.</p>
<p>A list of these buildings may be found in the Oregon Historical
Quarterly for June, 1934. Photographs and facsimiles of the blueprints
may be inspected at the Oregon Historical Society Library
in Portland or purchased through the National Archives in Washington,

<br /><i>Irene S. Story</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="535" />
</div>
<p>According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the
Multnomah Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution
on May 12, 1939, &ldquo;College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous
use for Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains.
Here were educated men and women who have won recognition
throughout the world in all the learned profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this building Tualatin Academy developed into what is now
Pacific University. When the Academy was chartered in 1849, the
classes met in the log cabin erected for the Congregational Church
in West Tualatin Plains, now Forest Grove. But in 1850 the board
of trustees authorized the erection of a two-story frame building.
Here are the words of one of the students, Marcus W. Walker, concerning
the &ldquo;raising&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in 1850 but in the early summer and never did a brighter
sun shine through, a bluer sky or more brilliant green bedeck forest
and grove and plain than did those in which boys reveled during
those days in which the frame of the old Academy building was
placed in position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;All spring, men and teams had been hewing out and hauling
timbers while other men under the oversight of &lsquo;Squire Tuttle,&rsquo; as
he was familiarly called, had been framing them and now they were
ready to be put together. It was yet in the days of log houses and
&lsquo;bee-raisings&rsquo; and notices and invitations had been sent out naming
the day when everything would be ready. Men with families came
from other neighborhoods in white-covered ox wagons, camping out
for the time, and the affair greatly resembled the old-fashioned
camp meeting. Tables were set in the old log building, partly school
house, partly church, which has passed into history as the birthplace
of Tualatin Academy and Pacific University, where bountiful
dinners were provided by the women for the men at work. This
department being under the energetic oversight of &lsquo;Grandma Brown&rsquo;
with her somewhat stern face and dignified bearing, but we knew
that behind them lay the kindest heart that ever befriended a homeless
orphan whose name is, if possible, more intimately associated
with the history of this institution than that of Rev. Harvey Clark,
its founder and patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Tuttle gave the signal, &lsquo;He-oh-heave&rsquo; and up it went and
settled into place. Money was scarce in those days and houses were
built in a hurry so a winter and a summer passed away before even
one room was ready. It was a frosty morning in October 1851 when
25 or 30 of us gathered in the lower north room and school began
with J. M. Keeler on the platform. The fresh ceiling on the walls
and overhead, the large new blackboard, the new double desks,
homemade as they were, all combined to make it a veritable palace,
used as we were to the rough log walls of the old building with its
rough benches and long shelf running around the sides for desks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building cost about $7,000 and the trustees were $2,000 in
debt. The Rev. Harvey Clark gave 200 acres of land at first; this
plot of ground was divided into lots and many of them were sold
to help pay for the building. Later he gave more land for the same
purpose. Tabitha Brown mentions in a letter that she gave $100, a
big sum in those days, especially for a woman of 69 or 70 years of
age earning her own money. Mrs. Mary Walker, wife of Rev. Elkanah
Walker, gave her watch which was sold and the sale price
added. Others gave generously also and the Society for the Promotion
of College and Theological Education in the East contributed
to the upkeep of the Academy.</p>
<p>In 1854, the Territorial Legislature granted a new charter with
full collegiate privileges to &ldquo;Tualatin Academy and Pacific University.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Carl H. Francis</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="446" />
</div>
<p>The impressive home of General Joel Palmer, with its stately
columns, catches the eye and excites the curiosity. In Dayton&rsquo;s
City Park one of the few authentic blockhouses remaining, compels
attention, and each year thousands of tourists read that it stands as
a memorial to General Palmer; out of the dusty past ride the well-known
figures of Sheridan, Grant, Russell (who died at the Battle
of Winchester), Wheeler, (both of the Confederacy in the War between
the States and of the Union in the Spanish-American War),
all identified with the historic blockhouse. But no note is made of
the regal structure which views the passing parade from its vantage
point of the State Highway which traverses the small town; and
history has itself passed by one of the most colorful persons who
helped hammer out the destiny of Oregon.</p>
<p>Let us look first for a moment to this man&mdash;a man who shaped
the future, first of the Indians who occupied the land, and then of
his fellow countrymen. As Superintendent of Indian Affairs, he negotiated
the treaties whereby the red man ceded title to the Oregon
Country; these were ratified by the United States Senate and became
the law of the land. Because of his humanitarian attitude
toward the Indians, Palmer was the victim of unfair criticism. But
when the Whitman massacre resulted in the Cayuse Indian War,
Palmer readily took the field against the errant, and it was in this
War that his title of &ldquo;General&rdquo; was obtained. Yet all the while, he
served his fellow countrymen in numerous ways. In Indiana he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
been a member of the legislature before his first trip to Oregon in
1845.</p>
<p>As Faith Holdredge Watts says, he was then &ldquo;on a journey of
exploration, to test the feasibility of taking his family out later and
establishing a permanent home there.&rdquo; He was immediately elected
captain of one company and in the fall of that year with Sam Barlow
established what is now known as the &ldquo;Barlow Trail&rdquo;&mdash;a portent
perhaps of how perverse history would refuse to recognize this
leader, and give its laurels to another. Palmer then platted the
Town of Dayton in 1850, setting aside the City Park as a &ldquo;Court
House Square&rdquo; and the Brookside Cemetery in which he was later
buried. His picture, in the Oregon State Capitol, looks down upon
each Speaker of the Oregon Legislature, for he was the second
Speaker of the Assembly&mdash;but again, perverse history dismisses him
with a reference to a &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; Palmer; he was a State Senator, refused
to run as a candidate for the United States Senate while in government
employment, but in 1870, was the candidate of the burgeoning
Republican Party for Governor, being defeated by less than 700
votes. He was characterized as a &ldquo;man of honesty and integrity.&rdquo;
This was the man who built the house.</p>
<p>The house itself has been rebuilt, added to, and a part destroyed.
Gertrude Palmer, granddaughter of the General, lives today
in Lafayette, Oregon, and her mind leaps quickly back to the
olden days; she recalls as a small child holding her grandmother&rsquo;s
hand while the original structure (one story and attic, with a
double fireplace) was demolished. In the 1860&rsquo;s, Palmer built an
additional part which was remodeled in 1911, giving the present
structure a &ldquo;southern plantation&rdquo; look. Palmer&rsquo;s original Dayton
home was Dutch Colonial. He was a &ldquo;bound boy&rdquo; in his youth;
with no formal education, he struggled to achieve the recognition
he received. The house would reflect his personality.</p>
<p>To this home, says his granddaughter, came orphans&mdash;and one
sees here his hope that they be spared the rigors of his own youth.
One of these, Christopher Taylor, drove the wagon train that brought
Palmer&rsquo;s wife to Oregon. Christopher Taylor was from Dayton,
Ohio; and so the Oregon counterpart came to be named.</p>
<p>Palmer, although a distinguished leader in the pioneer community
of Oregon, was apparently not fully aware of Oregon&rsquo;s rainfall
when he built his home. To the Civil-war period portion of his
house (and incidentally, as a Republican leader he was strongly
pro-Union), he dug a deep-bricked cellar, which filled with water
during the winter months. Gertrude Palmer reminisces that when
it so filled, &ldquo;We used to get our shingle boats and play in the cellar.&rdquo;
This pastime became denied to juveniles with the 1911 remodelling.</p>

</div>
<p>Ten years after William Hobson settled near the site of Newberg
in 1875, the Friends had opened an academy for their children,
the first Quaker school in Oregon and the forerunner of Pacific College,
now George Fox.</p>
<p>In 1883 the pioneer Quaker parents, feeling the need of education
for their children beyond that offered in the Oregon public
schools, brought the subject of building an academy before the
Monthly Meeting. Mary Edwards, Dr. Elias Jessup, David Wood,
and Ezra Woodward were appointed to investigate.</p>
<p>By September, 1883, the committee reported $1,865 secured in
good notes and that the subscribers had met and decided to call
the school, Friends Pacific Academy.</p>
<p>C. J. Edwards recalled the establishment of the academy vividly.
&ldquo;One evening in the spring of 1884, as I was returning from
school, I noticed that someone had cut a wide swath of wheat down
along the west side of our garden and that several loads of lumber
had been hauled to the place where the Friends Church now stands....
My father said he was very much dissatisfied with having to
sell some of the land in the center of his farm for an academy
building but that he was so anxious to have the privileges of the
school for his family that he had consented to its erection near the
center of the 80-acre field on the spot where the Friends Church
now stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On September 28, 1885, Friends Pacific Academy, a school of
high school rank, opened its doors. Dr. Jessup had hauled the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
load of lumber with a mule team for the building, and Noah Heater
and Charles Vaughn had contracted for the carpenter work.</p>
<p>The first academy building was moved in 1892 to the present
campus where it became known as Hoover Hall in 1932 and was
used as a men&rsquo;s dormitory for twenty years. The architects declared
it was suffering from &ldquo;extreme fatigue,&rdquo; and it was torn down in
1954, destroying a wall on which tradition says Herbert Hoover
signed his name &ldquo;Bertie.&rdquo; The senior rose garden marks the site
of the historic academy building.</p>
<p>Among the first to enroll on opening day was Bert Hoover, later
thirty-first president of the United States. Then eleven years old,
he was living with his uncle, Dr. Henry Minthorn, Pacific&rsquo;s principal.
On the college&rsquo;s fiftieth anniversary Mr. Hoover was granted
Pacific&rsquo;s first honorary degree and his fiftieth.</p>
<p>When the academy opened, there were two of senior rank, eleven
in the first year, twelve in the second, and thirty-four in the first
year of the grammar department. There were two teachers besides
Dr. Minthorn.</p>
<p>Six years later there were 125 students attending classes, and
one had graduated. The Quakers were now confronted with the
problem of providing further education for their children, and,
since the nearest Quaker college was in Iowa, they decided to start
their own.</p>
<p>Pacific College opened its doors on September 9, 1891, with Dr.
Thomas Newlin as president. There were six other instructors. The
college&rsquo;s aim was that of &ldquo;offering to young men and women the
benefits of a liberal Christian education.&rdquo; Two juniors, four sophomores,
and seven deficient in preparatory work were enrolled in
the college; and 136, in the academy.</p>
<p>Pacific&rsquo;s first graduates were Clarence J. Edwards, son of Jessee
Edwards, in whose wheatfield the academy had been built; and
Amon C. Stanbrough, an early superintendent of Newberg schools.</p>
<p>In 1949-50, final action was taken to change the name of
Pacific College to George Fox. It was felt that the increasing confusion
of Pacific College with Pacific University at Forest Grove
and the use of Pacific in the names of other schools on the Pacific
coast made such a change imperative.</p>
<p>There are few colleges that send a larger proportion of their
graduates into the so-called sacrificial fields, as teachers, preachers,
or missionaries. George Fox, the fifth oldest Quaker college in the
United States, emphasizes constantly the ideal of service rather than
selfishness, and of character as well as scholarship.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="438" />
</div>
<p>George W. Eberhard, at the age of 22, arrived at San Francisco
by way of Panama from the State of Michigan. He remained
in California for five years and came to Oregon by boat in 1859.
The following year he bought 320 acres of the Pierre Belleque farm
above Champoeg. At that time only 60 acres were cleared. He paid
$1,500 for this land which had been farmed by the Belleque family
over 25 years. Because of technical regulations in the Land Grant
laws, no clear title had been issued, and it was 28 years before Mr.
Eberhard was able to secure his official title.</p>
<p>This farm belongs to the very earliest period of Oregon history,
having been the location of one of the first fur-trading posts in the
entire Northwest Country. It was established by members of the
Astor expedition in 1812, and when the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
came to this Western Empire a decade later, they took charge and
maintained it as a supply depot and relay farm for brigades going
to the Umpqua and country to the south.</p>
<p>It is in the big bend of the Willamette River in Marion County,
located two miles west of Champoeg on the river road to Newberg.
Highway 219 to the new bridge is the west boundary of the original
farm. A historical marker has been erected near the bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Pierre Belleque, who came with the Northwest Fur Company
from Canada, settled here in 1831 to develop a farm and home and
raise a family, along with other retired fur company men. His
neighbor to the west was Etienne Lucier. Here they became prominent
in the early history and development of the Northwest Country,
long before the wagon trains began to roll over the Oregon trail.</p>
<p>It was the house of Belleque which had been the chief trader&rsquo;s
house, built in the French style, having lapped siding; and dressed
lumber was used for finishing. The house had been lined with flowered
glazed chintz, a piece of which is still preserved. An outstanding
feature was the glass in French-style windows, while the usual log
cabins with parchment windows and rough lumber comprised the
homes of his neighbors.</p>
<p>Mr. Eberhard, a bachelor, was living here when the flood of
1861 destroyed so many homes and towns along the Willamette. He
saved it from going down to destruction in the swirling waters and
anchored it on a higher bench of land. Here he brought his bride,
Louisa J. Jones in 1865. Soon he began hewing the timbers and
building their new home, moving into it in 1869. They used the
handmade mantel from the chief trader&rsquo;s house, and many of the
doors and windows. To them were born six children&mdash;five boys and
a girl, Barbara, who married Henry J. Austin, one of the early merchants
of Newberg. They had two children&mdash;Louise Austin of the
Friendsview Manor in Newberg and George Kenneth, who with his
wife still lives in this house in its park-like setting of stately old
black walnut and hickory trees. This grandson was among the first
to develop an extensive irrigation project. Today he operates a
modern dairy.</p>
<p>Although the house has been remodeled, much of the original
handwork can be seen. The broadaxe used to fashion the beams
still stands by the fireplace. The original hand-dressed flooring remains
in one room nailed with handwrought iron nails. One of the
original shingles, hand-split and gently tapered with plane or draw-knife,
is preserved.</p>
<p>The family has collected shards of china, pottery, old pipe stems
and bowls, and various relics from the site of the old trading post,
which portion of the farm was sold many years ago.</p>
<p>To this farm belongs the honor of having reared enterprising
citizens from the time Pierre Belleque was appointed as one of the
first constables&mdash;before the formation of our provisional government&mdash;to
the present day, when the son of Mr. and Mrs. G. K. Austin
aided in the designing of portions of our modern-day missiles.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Champoeg Farm House</span>
<br /><i>Henry Zorn</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="491" />
</div>
<p>The house on Champoeg Farm was built between 1867-70, by
John Hoefer and Casper Zorn. It is a combination of southern and
western design, a two-story frame building, consisting of fourteen
rooms. The structure has a brick pillar foundation and the pillars
are covered with zinc sheeting, to protect the sills from moisture.
The fir lumber used in the building was produced on the farm and
wrought-iron square nails were used in the construction. In the
front part of the house the lumber was planed, tongue and groove,
by hand.</p>
<p>This building was enlarged in the 1880&rsquo;s to its present size. In
1896, a bell tower, on the roof at the rear of the house, was added.
The bell was to call the farm hands from the field at the noon hour.
In the same year, the windmill tower was built.</p>
<p>The house was completely furnished; carpeting with large floral
designs, heavy drapes, and such furniture as was in use at that
period, along with many pioneer articles.</p>
<p>The house is in the center of the Robert Newell Donation Land
Claim, surrounded by about 950 acres of fertile farm and timber
land. The name Champoeg Farm was registered June 9, 1913, in
the Marion County Clerk&rsquo;s office, Salem, Oregon. The reason for
naming the farm was to give it an identity. The largest Indian village
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
in the Willamette Valley was located here. The French Prairie
was known as Champoeg Country. Champoeg District, which extended
from the Willamette River to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains, was named by the Provisional Government. The first
flour mill of 1835, and all succeeding mills were known as the
Champoeg mills. The establishment of the first American government
on the Pacific Coast occurred here. The townsite of Champoeg
was situated on the northwest section of the farm.</p>
<p>There were a number of individuals who had a part in the development
of the farm by ownership or otherwise, who made history
by their courage and determination and who became useful
members of a new state. I am mentioning the names of the most
prominent: Robert Newell, Donald Manson, William Bailey, Thomas
McKay, William Cannon, John Ball, William Johnson, George Laroque,
John Hoefer and Casper Zorn. Personally I have owned the
farm over fifty-two years.</p>
<p>John Hoefer sailed from Europe to New Orleans; the voyage
took six weeks before arriving. For two years he worked as a cabinet
maker and then he came by wagon train to California and
thence to Oregon by steamer, coming to the Champoeg district in
1852. After arrival, he worked as a cabinet maker and carpenter,
building houses for the settlers.</p>
<p>John Zorn, his two sons, and daughter came from Europe to
New York and then to Baraboo, Wisconsin; and after a time, decided
the Pacific Northwest was the place to establish their home.
They went down the Mississippi River by boat to New Orleans,
then by steamer to Panama, across the Isthmus, and then by steamer
to California, and from there by steamer to the Oregon country,
settling in the Champoeg district in 1854.</p>
<p>John Hoefer married Anne, the daughter of John Zorn. Casper
Zorn, the older of the two sons, became a partner of John Hoefer.
Adam, being a boy, chored around until he became old enough to
go on his own.</p>
<p>Hoefer and Zorn ran the old tavern, where the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company quarters had been. They also had a bowling alley, at the
townsite of Champoeg. All their property was lost during the flood
of 1861.</p>
<p>On February 3, 1862, Hoefer and Zorn bought the flour and
gristmill, which had been damaged by recent flood, repaired it, and
operated it for fourteen and one-half years. Then on February 24,
1866, they purchased 146 acres from Robert Newell, and the Champoeg
Farm house was built on the present site.</p>

<p>In the late fall of 1834, under heavy rains, Jason Lee and his
few co-laborers built the log cabin which was to house the Oregon
Indian Mission of the Methodist Church. The crudely built cabin
of twenty-by-thirty feet was on the banks of the Willamette River,
about ten miles below the present city of Salem. As the mission
became an Indian orphanage and school, and its mission workers
and their families increased in numbers, the log cabin received additions;
and a small colony of cabins serving as homes, utility buildings,
and work shops grew. These buildings were swept away by
the flood of 1861, almost twenty years after the mission activities
had been transferred to the present site of Salem.</p>
<p>Only one building of the old mission structures survived the
flood. This was the first frame structure, built in 1838, to house
the mission doctor, Elijah White; and later added to, so it could
serve as the mission hospital. The site selected for the first frame
structure was on higher ground, about a mile east of the mission
log buildings on the river bank. The location today is on the Wheatland
Ferry Road, about ten miles from Salem, on what is now
(1963) known as the Mission Blueberry Farm. Oregon&rsquo;s oldest
frame house is privately owned and occupied, as it has been during
most of its century and a quarter of history. When the Old Hospital
was first known to the writer, about 1920, it was called the Beers&rsquo;
house because of its long ownership by the Alanson Beers family.
This mission family had originally acquired it from the Oregon Mission,
when it closed its Indian Mission in 1844. At the time I first
visited the house it was unoccupied and showed considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
neglect. In the years since, it has passed through a succession of
owners, most of whom have appreciated its historic significance and
kept it in fine repair.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the first reinforcement of mission workers,
including the first physician, Dr. White, in 1837, and others in 1838,
the living conditions in the old mission quarters were impossibly
crowded. In a book published in 1848, based on Dr. Elijah White&rsquo;s
source materials, the writer says: &ldquo;There was some difficulty in accommodating
the new comers, but they were obliged to enter the
house with the old inmates, already numerous.... (This) made
Mrs. White anxious to remove to their own house, which they did
in a few days although it was not fit condition for inhabitants.
There was no chimney in it, and but roof enough to cover a bed;
a few loose boards for a floor, and one side entirely unenclosed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house was completed as soon as possible. But as there was
no suitable stone at hand for the hearth, it was made of clay and
ashes &ldquo;which after drying, became measurably though not perfectly
hardened. But one of Mrs. White&rsquo;s greatest domestic privations was
that she could never wash her hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the mission carpenters, under W. H. Willson, finished the
house, and Mrs. White was settled, she made it a home which won
praise from the wife of the Fort Vancouver chaplain, the Rev. Herbert
Beaver, when she and her husband visited the Whites. &ldquo;They
were much pleased with everything around them, especially the
indoor arrangements. &lsquo;Why, Mrs. White,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beaver &lsquo;how
nice this is; it looks as though a white woman&rsquo;s hands had been
here. This is the first white woman&rsquo;s house I have been in since my
arrival in this country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many visitors besides the Beavers stayed at the White home,
including Dr. Marcus Whitman, from the American Board Missions;
Dr. McLoughlin, and visiting missionaries from the Hawaiian
Islands. From the size of the retinue which accompanied Dr. and
Mrs. McLoughlin, and the description of their camping equipment,
it must have been that they camped near the house while they visited,
as the party could never have been housed under its roof.</p>
<p>We have a description of the Mission Hospital, as it was some
years after Dr. White&rsquo;s occupancy, from Lt. Charles Wilkes, a
United States government exploring agent, who visited the Willamette
Valley in June 1841. &ldquo;We rode on to the log houses which the
Messrs. Lee built when they first settled here. In the neighborhood
are the wheelwright&rsquo;s and blacksmith&rsquo;s, together with their workshops,
belonging to the mission, and about a mile to the east, the
hospital, built by Dr. White, who was formerly attached to the
mission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wheatland Ferry crossed the Willamette River at a very historical
pioneer spot. Jason Lee chose the location for the first
Methodist Mission of the valley, a short distance south of the village
of Wheatland on the east side of the river. There were no
roads, so traveling was by water or horse-back, and the first river
crossings were in Indian canoes, with often a horse swimming behind.</p>
<p>In 1837, David Leslie came to help at the Mission, bringing his
wife and three daughters. They lived in a log cabin on the west
side of the river and crossed to the Mission. By 1840 two more
daughters were born. They were the first white children born in
Yamhill County. In 1843, Daniel Matheny crossed the plains and
took up a donation land claim reaching the river at Wheatland. His
family operated a ferry across the river for many years, beginning
in flat bottom skiffs, and later with a flat boat for wagons.</p>
<p>Here is a story of pioneer days. Matheny&rsquo;s oldest son was told
by his mother that he was too big to go to Camp Meeting without
shoes, so he would have to stay home. This was a sad situation
as Camp Meeting was the social event of the year. An Indian
woman came to the river and signaled for him to come over to take
her across. When he reached her he saw her moccasins and began
to bargain for them. At first she shook her head, and he began to
empty his pockets. At last she consented and he ran home waving
his moccasins.</p>
<p>The land around Wheatland was settled rapidly in the 1840&rsquo;s,
and as wheat was the main export, a warehouse and boat landing
were built a quarter of a mile south of the ferry by Miles Hendrick.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Wheat was raised on both sides of the river. There is no high
ground on the east side of the Willamette river for buildings or
boat landings. The first warehouse was built a mile south of Wheatland
on a bluff near the west bank of the Willamette river. It went
out in the 1890 flood. The other one was built about a quarter of a
mile north of Wheatland. After harvest the ferry was busy bringing
wheat from across the river to the warehouse to be shipped on
river boats.</p>
<p>I remember the ferry in the late 1890&rsquo;s. It was a thrill to cross
the river on it; but as the charge was twenty-five cents one way
and forty cents round trip, we didn&rsquo;t cross often. As children, my
cousin and I used to go down and ride across free when the ferry
man was taking a wagon. He never refused us and no child
drowned from the ferry at that early day.</p>
<p>After the Matheny family moved away, the ferry was owned by
John Isham, Bill Isham, Dick Wood, and Lane Davidson. While
Davidson ran it, a new ferry boat was built. In the early 1930&rsquo;s,
Clyde Lafollette bought the ferry and built a cabin on the ferry so
that his son, Clarence, could sleep there and be ready to take late
travelers across. There were current boards on the ferry that made
the river current help push it across. If the current wasn&rsquo;t strong
enough, the operator had to help with his own strength. Later Mr.
Lafollette put a gasoline engine on the ferry to help while the river
was low in the summer time.</p>
<p>In 1937, the communities on each side of the river, backed by
Clyde Lafollette, began pressing for a free ferry supported by the two
counties it connected. Yamhill and Marion counties took over the
ferry that year, hiring two men to run it and keeping it open from
six a.m. until five p.m. They installed a new gasoline ferry and, of
course, ferry travel increased.</p>
<p>Tom Bowden, who is still working on the ferry, began operating
the gasoline ferry in 1940. Other helpers have been Roy Lafollette,
George Frauendeiner, Frank Hersha, and Frank&rsquo;s son, Erwin Hersha
is the second operator at the present time. There have been
two drownings near the ferry on the Wheatland side; Jackie Worthington
in 1941 and Sonny Lindsey in 1947. Both were in their early
teens and could swim a little. In 1947, a new electric ferry was
built that could handle six cars at a crossing, and in the summer
time it was often kept busy. In 1959, the present ferry was purchased.
It is an all-steel electric one and handles six large cars.</p>
<p>The Wheatland Ferry is one of the few remaining on the Willamette
River. In crossing it, you get a wonderful view both up
and down the Willamette. If you enjoy the romance of a ferry, do
come and cross the Beautiful Willamette on the Wheatland Ferry.</p>

</div>
<p>George Kirby Gay was born in Gloucestershire, England, in
1796. Gay went to sea at a very early age as a messboy on a voyage
to the South Sea Islands and other foreign ports. He left London
on the whaler &ldquo;Kitty.&rdquo; Landing in New York, he made his way
westward to Missouri, where he joined the Pacific Fur Company as
camp-tender. Soon he started the overland trek through the wilderness,
arriving at Astoria in 1812. The following year, Gay left Astoria
and for years sailed the seas to all parts of the world.</p>
<p>After his seafaring life, he left ship at Monterey, California, and
joined a trapping expedition, soon starting overland to reach the
Willamette Valley and the Columbia River, knowing, however,
white men might be found. He was a survivor of the Rogue River
Massacre, finally arriving at Wyeth&rsquo;s Trading Post on Sauvies Island
in August, 1835.</p>
<p>The following year, Gay was one of twenty to make the attempt
to stock the country with cattle. A goodly number of Spanish cattle
were brought through and the Colony benefited by this first business
venture. While driving the herd through the Siskiyou Mountains,
the company was ambushed. Gay received a fearful wound
from an Indian&rsquo;s arrow. The Spanish cattle brought from California,
enabled Gay to build herds that roamed Yamhill and Polk Counties.</p>
<p>Now, being settled somewhat, he thought of a home in the heart
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the green Willamette wilderness. He busied himself with the
making of brick from the local clay. Clay dug from a nearby pit
was &ldquo;tramped bare-footed,&rdquo; molded, and burned into brick on the
place. With these first Oregon-made red brick, the first brick house
west of the &ldquo;Rockies&rdquo; was constructed. As a site for the brick house,
Gay selected an elevated location, affording a view in all directions.
A two-story home with 14-foot walls, built of brick three courses
thick was built. At each end of this home was an inside fireplace
two feet deep. Hand-dressed woodwork and particularly the woodwork
around the fireplaces, handcarved, bore mute evidence of the
taste and patience of the one who dreamed of a mansion on a hill.
The south wall was designated in Oregon records as a point in the
southern boundary of Yamhill County. Here was the scene of unbounded
hospitality.</p>
<p>Gay entertained officers of the U. S. Navy and all officers of the
British men-of-war, who were visiting in the Columbia. This home
was a resort for any and all travelers and immigrants who sought
its shelter. He had many servants. During the 1840&rsquo;s, this house
resounded to discussions about Oregon&rsquo;s provisional government.
Meetings were called in March for the purpose of devising means
of protection for the herds and to protect the lives of the settlers.
At the March 6, 1843 meeting, Gay was chosen one of a committee
of 12 to take into consideration the propriety of taking measures for
the civil and military protection of the colony. It was this meeting
which promoted the epochal meeting at Champoeg of May 2, 1843.</p>
<p>For 40 years, Gay was esteemed by companions as a rollicking
good fellow, whose temperament and adventures were becoming to
the sailor, fur trapper, valiant Indian fighter, and frontiersman of
the early 19th century. He was not a man to be trifled or fooled
with, but a useful member in his community&mdash;in short, he undertook
any and all irregular sort of business, and few things with him were
impossible&mdash;all had much confidence in him. A handsome, athletic
man of powerful physique, he was kind and gentle in his behavior
and always good-natured. He was a fine horseman and an expert
with the lasso.</p>
<p>For years he was the wealthiest man in the Willamette Valley,
outside of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. Like many of the old, generous,
and hospitable pioneers, he died poor&mdash;in his own home&mdash;a
remarkable career man. The career of the intrepid George Kirby
Gay ended, October 7, 1882.</p>

<br /><i>Dr. James Matthew Alley</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="511" />
</div>
<p>The Amity Church of Christ was born in a pioneer log cabin
about two miles north of present-day Amity in March of 1846. This
makes it the oldest Christian Church of the Disciples of Christ,
west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Elder Amos Harvey, a pioneer of 1845, was the organizer of this
congregation of thirteen charter members. In a letter to an Eastern
religious journal, he tells of the humble beginning of this congregation
in these simple words: &ldquo;We met, as the disciples anciently did,
upon the first day of the week, to break the loaf, to implore the assistance
of the Heavenly Father, and to encourage each other in the
heavenly way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amos Harvey was born of Pennsylvania Quaker stock. The
Revolutionary Battle of Brandywine was fought on his kinsman&rsquo;s
land. When a young man, he married Miss Jane Ramage, a member
of the Christian Church, and after their marriage he became a
member of the same church. He was the organizer of Bethel College
in Polk County, chartered in 1856. He had one of the first
fruit nurseries in the Oregon Territory and was one of the first officers
of the state horticulture society. He was one of the founders
of the Republican party in the state.</p>
<p>The second minister of the Amity Church of Christ was Glen O.
Burnett, a pioneer of 1846. Soon after his arrival in the Amity area,
we find him busy preaching, baptizing, marrying, and burying the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
citizens of this area. He performed his first marriage, shortly after
his arrival in 1846, in the cabin of Joseph Watt, another pioneer of
the Amity community. Elder Burnett was a hard-working circuit
rider. He was a close friend of Amos Harvey, and the two of them
kept the Amity church alive in its infancy. A great amount of credit
goes to the laymen of the Amity church of this period. They were
the real leaders of the community, and they in turn supported Harvey
and Burnett with all that they had to offer in a material way,
which was very little. But what they lacked in material help they
made up in their faithfulness to this pioneer church.</p>
<p>The congregation met in the homes of the members until 1849,
when a log school house was built in the north end of present-day
Amity. A young schoolmaster by the name of Ahio S. Watt named
it Amity. And we find that Elder Glen O. Burnett &ldquo;delivered the
principal address when the first school in Amity was opened in the
spring of 1849.&rdquo; The California gold rush took some of the members
to the goldfields for a few years. The Indian and Civil wars
retarded the progress of the little church. It was not until 1869 or
1870 that it had its first building.</p>
<p>The ground for this building was given by Enos Williams, who
also gave the village square in front of the church to the children of
Amity in perpetuity. The building was erected by a pioneer carpenter,
Charles Burch. This building served the congregation until
1912, when the present church building was erected seventy-five
feet west of the original structure. The old building was moved to
another part of town and is still used for church purposes by another
religious communion.</p>
<p>Enos Williams, William Buffum, and Robert Lancefield were
charter members of this church. They were leaders in the community,
school, and church life of this period. These laymen did
not confine their good work to the Amity area alone. When circuit
riders Harvey and Burnett founded Bethel College in Polk County,
they sent their children to its high school department and college
classes, or supported it with financial help. The pioneer Amity
Church of Christ is not a story about a wooden building as much
as it is a story of great men, both its ministers and its laymen&mdash;men
who were willing to sacrifice for their faith.</p>
<p>The church at one time was in grave financial difficulty. There
was a possibility of losing its building. A member, Heber Martin,
then past seventy years of age, went to the bank and offered to
mortgage his farm to save the church building from a mortgage
foreclosure. Happily, this man&rsquo;s faith aroused the community and
the property was saved.</p>

<p>In the figures of the 1850 census, there were no illiterate persons
in Polk County. This was due to the high quality of the pioneers
who settled in this area of present-day Yamhill and Polk Counties,
which was called &ldquo;The Athens of the West.&rdquo; Between the years of
1843 and 1860 some of the best educated and most dedicated men
ever to come over the Oregon Trail gravitated to this section of the
Oregon Territory. Wherever they settled they started a school and
a church. Many of them were members of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>It was only natural that a circuit rider preacher, Elder Glen O.
Burnett, should call the people of this religious communion together
in a camp meeting in an oak grove near Bethel in 1852. At this
meeting the idea of Bethel College was conceived.</p>
<p>In 1851 a physician and surgeon, Dr. Nathaniel Hudson, took a
land claim in this &ldquo;Athens of the West.&rdquo; The first thing he did was
to build a log schoolhouse; and in the late spring and early summer
of 1852, he held the first public school in the area. Because of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
superior education, the Doctor was able to teach the higher
branches of education which was not possible in most of the pioneer
schools.</p>
<p>In 1854, Dr. Hudson sold his squatters&rsquo; rights at Bethel and took
a claim two miles west of Dallas. The pioneer families about Bethel
had come to depend fully on Dr. Hudson&rsquo;s school, and its loss was
a severe one to the whole community.</p>
<p>Two Christian preachers, Amos Harvey and Glen O. Burnett
gave 261 acres of their donation land claims for the financing of
Bethel Institute, later Bethel College. This was near the first of the
year in 1855. A two-story frame building, 36 &times; 44 feet in dimension,
was proposed. From March until July 4, 1855, materials were gathered
on the grounds for the college building &ldquo;raising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the &ldquo;glorious Fourth of &rsquo;55,&rdquo; men with their families in
wagons began arriving. Some came from great distances. Besides
carpenter work, there was a sermon, a patriotic address, and a basket
dinner. At the close of the day, the main framework of the
building, with its roof in place, was done. The building was finished
and dedicated, October 22, 1855. Bethel Institute was chartered
by the Territorial Legislature on January 11, 1856. Four years
later, on October 19, 1860, Governor John Whiteaker signed the
charter of Bethel College, which has never been revoked.</p>
<p>Although for many years Bethel College has ceased to function
as far as actual classes are concerned, it still exists. It has a board
of trustees, and owns the college property&mdash;the ground on which
Bethel Elementary Grade School is located. It elects a board of
trustees each year, and has the power to grant degrees.</p>
<p>Too little is known about this college which gave Oregon one
governor; the wife of a United States Senator; and many who later
became lawyers, school teachers, and clergymen. One of the founders
of Bethel College, Amos Harvey, gave to the United States
Senate his great-granddaughter, the Honorable Maurine Neuberger.</p>
<p>Each year in midsummer the alumni association and the descendants
of the pioneers of Bethel gather on the grounds for an
all-day picnic and annual meeting.</p>

</div>
<p>In Waverly, Ohio, Nicholas Lee and Sarah Hopper were married
August 4, 1840. That same year they moved from Ohio to Iowa,
while Iowa was still a territory. In the spring of 1847, they left for
Oregon, fully equipped with a good team of oxen, two cows (Rose
and Lilly) and necessary household goods. Raids by Indians upon
the cattle of the train and losses by stampedes left them practically
without a team. They threw away much of the household goods
and fortunately purchased a yoke of oxen (Dave and George) from
another train, enabling them to complete the journey.</p>
<p>The Lees and quite a number of others took the Southern route
via Klamath Lake and Cow Creek Canyon. Of the train coming
down the Columbia, several stopped at Dr. Marcus Whitman&rsquo;s station
and were ruthlessly murdered or captured in the Indian massacre
of November 29 and 30, 1847.</p>
<p>It was late in the fall when the Lees reached the head of the
Willamette Valley, for the trip was a hard one, especially Cow
Creek Canyon. The cattle were weak and jaded. Elias Briggs, who
had safely brought a hive of bees that far, lost them when his
wagon was overturned in the water.</p>
<p>The Lees and James Fredericks selected claims and built cabins
not far from Eugene Skinner&rsquo;s, after whom the city of Eugene was
named. In the spring of 1848, Frederick and Lee with their families
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
came to Polk County, seeking work and supplies. Their intention
was to return, but hearing that the Indians had burned their cabins
they decided to remain. They had the use of a two-room cabin for
a time.</p>
<p>The winter of 1848 and 1849 was spent by the Lees in Salem.
The California gold rush was on, and Mr. Lee, a cooper by trade,
made pack saddles that winter and sold them to men leaving for
the mines.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1849, they returned to Polk County and
bought a claim two and one-half miles south of Dallas. The transition
from the cabin to the &ldquo;new house&rdquo; was an important event
with the pioneer family in 1852. The house is still in use but has
been remodeled. Mr. Lee took an active part in establishing church
and schools in Dallas and its area. In 1854, he was licensed as a
preacher of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and is credited with
organizing the original Methodist Society.</p>
<p>In 1855, Mr. Lee took the lead in building a log school house on
the John Nicholas place. His two older children attended. Soon
afterwards a move started for an independent academy in Dallas.
Lee was one of the members of the first board of trustees, and
served as treasurer. Land and money were donated, and the town
site was moved from the north side of La Creole Creek to the south
side.</p>
<p>In 1856-57 were built the new courthouse and jail. The La
Creole Academic Institute had two rooms ready for school opening,
February 15, 1857. Professor Horace Lyman and Miss Lizzie Boise
were the teachers. The Lee children, as they grew large enough,
walked three miles to school. To give the children advantage of
winter school, Mr. Lee built a house in Dallas, which they occupied
at times until the fall of 1862, when Mr. Lee started a small store
in Dallas and they moved to town.</p>
<p>The Academy served as a school for all age groups until the
1880&rsquo;s. The first public grade school building was erected about
1882.</p>
<p>In 1900, La Fayette Seminary, organized by a board of trustees
of the Educational Association of the Evangelical church, was incorporated
with La Creole Academic Institute in Dallas. It was
known as Dallas College and La Creole Academy. The combined
schools were endowed by the church. A dormitory was erected in
1900, costing $3000. The Woolen Mill property was purchased for
$1,500, and&mdash;for the expenditure of about $1,000 in repairs and remodeling&mdash;the
second floor was converted into a good gymnasium.</p>
<p>The schools closed in 1914 for lack of funds to meet the requirements
of Oregon standardization laws.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="412" />
</div>
<p>David Stump, of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, was born in Ohio
on October 20 (or 29) 1819. As guard, outriding scout and hunter,
he came to Oregon with the immigrant train of 1845. An experienced
surveyor, his services were in demand for surveying the virgin
territory of what is now Benton, Polk, and Yamhill counties. In
1851, he was married to Catherine Elizabeth Chamberlin, who had
come, a child of nine, with her family in the wagon train of 1844.</p>
<p>David and Catherine Stump took up a donation claim on the
Luckiamute River, six miles south of what later became the village
of Monmouth, being among the very first settlers in that part of the
Willamette valley. Here they prospered. They became devoted and
loyal members of the Christian Church, which soon established a
church-supported college in Monmouth. There were two sons and
two daughters. When these were ready for higher education, David
Stump acquired from the Lindsay family a home in Monmouth adjacent
to the college. It stood at the intersection of Jackson and
Monmouth streets on the southwest corner of a half-acre tract of
land, facing to the west the Victorian Wolverton place, with the
Orville Butler home to the north. This became&mdash;and continued for
many years as&mdash;the Stump family home. Here, after a long illness,
David Stump died on February 21, 1886.</p>
<p>In the mid-nineties the house was completely renovated and, to
a great extent, rebuilt. The roof was raised to give space for a large
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
attic. Rooms and porches were added. The position of the entrances
and chimneys was altered. In all, there were now seventeen
rooms. Miss Ellen Chamberlain, Mrs. Alice Applegate Peil, Miss
Antoinette Bruce, Miss Rose Bassett, Miss Lane, and other members
of the Normal faculty lived there around the turn of the century.
It became quite a center of college activities. Miss Cassie B. Stump
had inherited the property from her father.</p>
<p>There was a good-sized barn at the east end, occupied by a Jersey
cow and chickens and ornamented in Autumn with the glowing
red of Virginia Creeper. There were a berry patch, a large vegetable
garden with morning glories twining the corn stalks, and a
row of huge sunflowers. Mrs. Stump and her daughter were great
lovers of flowers. They had a small greenhouse for chrysanthemums,
smilax, cacti, and various exotic plants. A gnarled Gravenstein
produced great, juicy apples. There was a big white fig tree,
which froze to the ground periodically, but somehow managed to
survive. Directly behind the house stood two exceptionally tall
Black Republican cherry trees, a rare sight when in bloom and by
July covering the ground inches deep with an over-abundance of
ripe fruit. There were madonna lilies, amaryllis, the spike of a yucca,
and roses in profusion. A sweet Mission rose, brought to the
farm from California, then transplanted to town, was by the front
door. Inspired by a visit to the poet, Longfellow, during her student
days at Wellesley college, Miss Stump had planted a hedge of
lilacs modeled after his in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Not long after Miss Cassie Stump&rsquo;s death in 1941, the property
was acquired by the Oregon College of Education. The old house,
by now in a state of disrepair, and the once lovely garden, neglected
and overgrown, were removed to make way for the handsome,
modernistic library building and the appropriate landscaping with
which it is surrounded. A Jack pine and the great maples across the
front are about the sole reminders of the former occupancy of the
land.</p>
<p>A collection of pictures, records, and mementos of early days at
the college is housed in the library. It seems eminently suitable that
this particular site should become a permanent part of the campus
of the school, in the founding and support of which the Stump family
had had such a large share and in which the members had maintained
a vital interest over so many years.</p>

<p>The early settlers in the Willamette Valley were not only provident
and God-fearing, they were also deeply concerned with higher
education for their young people. Academies and colleges sprang
up in many of the valley communities. A group of prosperous farmers
in Polk County, consecrated members of the Christian Church,
gave land and financial support to found a church-affiliated school
at Monmouth, to become known as Christian College.</p>
<p>In 1869, Thomas Franklin Campbell was engaged to head this
institution. Originally from the deep South, he had come some
years previously to Helena, Montana, where he conducted a school
for boys and served as circuit judge. He was a man of wide interests
and abilities, having served in the Mexican war, and been active
as lawyer, minister, and promoter of various public projects.
But he was before all else an educator. As a student at Bethany
College in Virginia he had lived in the home of Alexander Campbell,
founder of the Christian Church. There he had acquired an
excellent classical education, had been ordained to the ministry,
and had married a cousin of Alexander Campbell, only recently arrived
from Ireland.</p>
<p>Responding to the call from Monmouth, with his wife, Jane
Eliza and their three sons, he made the long, arduous trip from
Helena to Oregon in a stagecoach. The challenging task for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
new administrator was to raise funds for a suitable, permanent
structure. He solicited earnestly over the state and very soon a
brick building, modelled as to general type after the Gothic-inspired
architecture of Bethany College, was constructed. It was
here that distinguished jurists and others prominent in Oregon life
received a thorough grounding in the classics. The curriculum was
mostly concerned with Greek, Latin, mathematics, logic, and philosophy.
Science was not at that time, as it is with us, a prime consideration.
The first graduating class was that of 1871.</p>
<p>By 1892, Christian College had been converted into a State
Normal School. There was imperative need in the state to train
teachers to meet the growing demands for their services. Prince
Lucian Campbell, son of Thomas Franklin Campbell, was now the
president. A new wing on the south was added to the original
building. This included a science laboratory, several large classrooms,
and an assembly hall known as &ldquo;the Chapel.&rdquo; The latter has
undergone some changes and is at present called &ldquo;Campbell Hall,&rdquo;
where hang the portraits of the two early presidents.</p>
<p>This new wing was surmounted by a bell tower from which the
strong-toned bell peremptorily summoned students to their morning
classes. Eventually the enlarged building was balanced with another
wing added on the north to house a training school. The
whole structure forms truly an historic Oregon Landmark, which is
held in fond affection by the many who have studied there.</p>
<p>A sad mutilation occurred in the great wind of Columbus Day
1962. The familiar belfry was toppled to hang precariously. The
forlorn picture was featured in newspapers and national magazines
as evidence of the violence and destructive power of the unprecedented
storm. Many great trees of the ancient fir grove and others
on the campus were badly damaged. Much is irreparable, but effort
is being made to replace the bell tower and to restore all
possible.</p>
<p>The Oregon College of Education, with the other institutions in
the State System of Higher Education, is experiencing a record enrollment.
There are new and modern buildings to meet increasing
demands. To foster tradition and the realization of past accomplishment,
and to stress the foundation on which present achievement
is based, the preservation and history of this original building
at the Oregon College of Education is of signal importance.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Fort Hoskins</span>
<br /><i>Preston E. Onstad</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="469" />
</div>
<p>The site of Fort Hoskins, Benton County&rsquo;s first military post,
was chosen by second lieutenant P. H. Sheridan with the help of
Oregon Indian Superintendent, Joel Palmer. The name Hoskins was
chosen by the Fort&rsquo;s first commander, Captain Christopher Colon
Augur, as his first official order, on July 26, 1856. For the next nine
years Fort Hoskins served as the home and training ground of regular
U. S. Army troops as well as volunteers from California, Washington,
and Oregon. Although a few troopers from Hoskins knew
some anxious moments in the early days, no shots were ever fired
into or out of the fort in anger. In fact, the biggest argument to affect
the Fort at any time was whether or not there was any excuse
for its existence.</p>
<p>Fort Hoskins was located at the Middle Pass over the Coast
Range of mountains to keep the surviving Indian participants of the
Rogue River War on the reservation which General Palmer had prepared
for them on the Oregon coast, near the present towns of
Newport and Siletz. However, the post was so far&mdash;some thirty
miles from the Indians&mdash;that a blockhouse had to be established on
the upper prairie of the Siletz River. Fort Hoskins supplied men,
munitions, and materiel for the blockhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Of the later generals who served there, at least two became
famous: Philip Sheridan, who located the site of the Fort and served
as its first quartermaster and commissary of supplies; and C. C.
Augur, who, during his five years in command, learned how to deal
with his superiors the hard way&mdash;by letter. In the Civil War, Sheridan
started his climb to fame as a commissary officer; and Augur,
who had developed into a persuasive writer, not only won battles
but served with distinction on many military courts and committees,
where his early training in mental organization served him
well.</p>
<p>Fort Hoskins also provided a training camp for western volunteers
between 1862 and the end of the Rebellion, although few of
the men who trained there ever heard the whir of Indian arrow or
the whine of enemy shot. They did, however, learn the rudiments
of the military discipline of living month in and month out with
themselves and with crushing boredom. At first only a sutler&rsquo;s store
catered to the wants of the soldiers, but at length a Corvallis firm,
hard on the trail of easy money, opened an establishment near the
post that dealt in a commodity the sutler&rsquo;s store was not allowed
to sell: spirits.</p>
<p>No Indians ever tried to attack Fort Hoskins, but during the
turbulent days of the Civil War, threats were made against the undermanned
Fort by Secessionists, of which there were many in the
immediate neighborhood. The nearest town of any size, Corvallis,
was notoriously sympathetic to the cause of the South and was contemptuously
known in other parts of the state of Oregon as the only
town that ever had a Copperhead mayor. To make matters worse,
this worthy was twice elected. Certain Southern sympathizers were
organized into a secret state-wide society called the &ldquo;Knights of the
Golden Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fort Hoskins was permanently evacuated on April 13, 1865, the
last company to leave being Captain Waters&rsquo; Company F of the
First Oregon Volunteer Infantry. A year later the buildings were
auctioned off, and the land, which had been rented, was returned
to the owners. In the accompanying photograph, the cluster of unpainted
farm buildings, left of center, stand on what was once the
parade ground of Fort Hoskins. The large farmhouse behind the
trees, at the right, rests on the site of the old hospital. On the light-colored
field between the trees and the hill, soldiers once drilled
and learned how to shoot at distant targets. Time and distance
have lent enchantment, of a sort that never really existed, to the
history of a lonely little frontier Fort in an all-but-forgotten corner
of Oregon.</p>

<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="481" />
</div>
<p>In 1858, the old Simpson&rsquo;s Chapel was completed. It stood on a
hill about halfway between the present towns of Bellfountain and
Alpine. The church was built of hand-planed lumber and was a
plain oblong with three windows on each side and a porch in front.
It was surrounded by oak trees, many of which are still standing
and which served as hitching posts for horses.</p>
<p>The history of the Alpine community may be said to have had
its beginning at the time of the erection of two buildings, the Ebenezer
school house and Simpson&rsquo;s Chapel, though it is true that quite
a number of settlers had come to the valley before that time. The
school house was built of logs and was situated on a promontory
about two miles south of the present town of Alpine and on part of
the old Gilbert place. It was probably built about 1849 and served
both as a school and a &ldquo;meeting house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was and always has been a Methodist Church and was called
Simpson&rsquo;s Chapel because Bishop Simpson was the presiding officer
of the first annual conference, held while the group was still meeting
in the old Ebenezer school. In 1903, it was decided that a new
church was needed, so one was built at the present site of Alpine
and was completed in 1904. At this time the congregation divided,
part of its members going to Bellfountain and part to Alpine.</p>
<p>The whole community was once known as the Belknap settlement
because of the preponderance of Belknaps among the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
settlers who, in pioneer days, had come by wagon train to the valley
from Ohio, Missouri, and Iowa. Other early families were the
Starrs, Hawleys, Howards, Gilberts, Catons, Woodcocks, Goodmans,
and Nichols.</p>
<p>Another interesting part of the early history of the Chapel centered
around the campground which, in 1871, was bought from
George Humphrey and is known as the Bellfountain Park. People
came from miles around, primarily for the spring of clear cold water,
held meetings, and visited. The gatherings were religious but also
social. People would bring food, put up tents, and stay for a week
or more. Sometimes someone would bring part of a beef and hang
it on a tree and those present were free to help themselves. The
pioneer days are gone but Simpsons Chapel is still used as a house
of worship by those who have taken the place of the pioneers.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1847, Mitchell Wilkins and his young wife, Permelia Ann
Allen, then eighteen, arrived on foot at &ldquo;The Falls.&rdquo; He was twenty-nine.
Their wagon, plus goods and tools, were beside the Barlow
Road with the last-dying oxen. Permelia&rsquo;s father Robert Allen, still
driving wagon and ox team, made their last miles easier. The three
pushed on from Oregon City toward Silverton and, on October 1,
came to Butte Creek. There they halted to build cabins, plow, and
plant. Ten months later my father was born. When the baby,
Francis Marion, was two months old, Mitchell Wilkins took a land
claim in upper Willamette Valley, edging the Coburg hills. During
the sixty years he lived there, the 640 acres grew to 20,000.</p>
<p>The pioneer home which replaced the original cabin was of
southern origin for Grandfather was of North Carolinian stock.
Built in 1854, it was low and wide with a small gallery above and
a wider one below facing the west and overlooking Centennial
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Butte where, in 1876, Mitchell Wilkins planted maple and fir trees.
He carried water by sled to the butte&rsquo;s very top to make sure the
trees would live. They stand, to the present day, like a tuft of hair
on an Indian&rsquo;s skull.</p>
<p>Willamette Forks post office was housed in one of the small
outer buildings, bringing neighbors together when stage or pony
rider dashed past on East Side Territorial Road, dropping off mail.
&ldquo;Late news&rdquo; was at best a month old but worth discussion as the
years brought disunion and secession problems to be faced among
southern democrats and members of the newly organized Republican
party. Indians had made the hillside trails which were to become
the Territorial Road, and Calapooias still roamed the trails
and dug camas roots in the blue-flowered fields.</p>
<p>When the Wilkinses built a cabin, there was not yet a Eugene
village. Mr. Skinner had only just brought his family to a sheep-herder&rsquo;s
cabin on the butte called Ya-po-ah, and had hardly formed
his dream for Eugene City. That town would one day be ten miles
south of the Wilkins home.</p>
<p>The land proved out Mitchell Wilkins&rsquo; plan for raising fine grain
and fine cattle. He took his prize grains to Philadelphia&rsquo;s Centennial
in 1876, New Orleans Exposition and Chicago&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition
in 1893, returning with honors for Lane County and Oregon.
He served in the State Legislature, 1862-64, there presented
Eugene&rsquo;s petition for incorporation, and was instrumental in its
passage. He was one of the men who organized Oregon&rsquo;s Agricultural
Society and Fair, which became the State Fair. He served as
an early president and on its board until paralysis forced him to
give up all activities. Inaction was hard for the tall, eager-eyed
Scotsman, but he endured it with a smile, though he was unable to
speak.</p>
<p>He had lived a full life. He had been a member of the &ldquo;Union
Club,&rdquo; a Civil-War-time club of Lincoln and Union enthusiasts as
determined and as secretive as the members of the secessionist
&ldquo;Knights of the Golden Circle.&rdquo; He saw the Union saved, saw Lincoln
elected; and rode the secret trail to the James Daniels house
in the hills where a few men swore allegiance by candlelight. My
father, at 13, was allowed to go there because he knew the words
to <i>John Brown&rsquo;s Body</i>. Oregon, a baby state, was half inclined to
secede and could not have supported Lincoln except for a division
among its Democrats&mdash;the loyalty of southerners like Mitchell Wilkins
who had come to settle in this Willamette Valley and who did
not want slavery for the West.</p>

<p>Deady Hall, the first building of the University of Oregon, was
the realization of a great dream. In 1803, a Government policy was
declared for the purpose of establishing State universities, this to
apply to any state entering the Union after that date. Forty-seven
years later, in 1850, by a donation land act, the Territory of Oregon
was given this grant.</p>
<p>At first, state politicians handed the Capitol to Salem, the Penitentiary
to Portland, and the University to Corvallis; then later it
was promised to Jacksonville. The controversy grew bitter, the
arguments so strong in every direction that the issue finally died of
overdoing.</p>
<p>In 1857, Judge Matthew P. Deady, a southerner and President of
the State Constitutional Convention, was much in favor of the parochial
school system, though later he was one of the most loyal supporters
of the University. Mr. R. S. Boise of Salem, with a large
group of northern followers, felt the state should have one nondenominational
school of importance, with lower fees, so the political
dickering continued. By 1872, the issue had built up in tension
and was again a red-hot argument.</p>
<p>On a July night of that year, a group of five men met to discuss
again the need of adequate schools. In the old McFarland home on
Charnelton street, kerosene lamps burned into the morning hours,
and the young be-whiskered gentlemen discussed the good of future
generations. They were B. F. Dorris, S. H. Speence, John M.
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Thompson, Judge J. J. Walton, and John C. Arnold. Later, J. S.
Scott, J. B. Underwood, S. S. Comstock, A. S. Patterson, E. L. Bristow,
E. L. Applegate, and Dr. A. W. Patterson joined them to organize
the Union University Association. John Thomas was elected
President, and T. G. Hendricks, Treasurer, while Walton, Dorris,
Scott, and Abrams formed the first board of directors. This board
appeared before the next meeting of the State Legislature to present
a bill permitting purchase of a site for the erection of the first
building on the new University campus. Fifty thousand dollars was
allowed for Deady Hall, to be completed and turned over to the
State in January, 1874. The bill also provided for a Board of Regents
of nine&mdash;six to be appointed by the governor and three by the
association itself. State scholarships were to be awarded by counties
and forbade any sectarian or religious tests for either students or
instructors.</p>
<p>Again plans ran into trouble. Outside interests appeared declaring
the location bill unconstitutional because &ldquo;<i>all state institutions
were to be located in Salem</i>.&rdquo; Again the pioneers fought for their
rights with good arguments; increased population, high standards
of living, value of land, and so on. In spite of all the evidence, opposing
elements obtained a revocation of the bond issue, and only
private subscriptions saved the university.</p>
<p>Committees were appointed for selection of the best site, and
ways of raising money. The final choice was left to the State board
of commission, which meeting in Eugene &ldquo;found the fine view from
the Henderson property most to their liking&rdquo; so, in April of 1873,
their selection was made of this thirteen-and-three-fourths-acre
tract.</p>
<p>The University was at last on its way, but it proved to be a very
rough road.</p>
<p>Plans were for a thirty-thousand-dollar bond issue by the courts,
with twenty thousand to be raised by private subscription. The financial
panic was on. Cash was scarce. Subscriptions came in slowly.
There were loud protests at tax time! But plans never stopped:
of the two hundred families making up the listed population, one
hundred and forty names were on the subscription list, many of
them for labor and farm produce. Thomas Judkins sold land at six
dollars an acre, the proceeds to go to the building. Churches helped
out with suppers and strawberry festivals.</p>
<p>At last Deady Hall was completed&mdash;as far as the roof, when
again money ran out and again citizens dug deep in their pockets
to complete the tall stately building, the first of the new University.</p>

<p>Applegate, one of the most famous names in Oregon history, belongs
to a family whose origin was English. As early as 1635, there
were Applegates who came to New England, and from there they
went to New Jersey, thence to Maryland, and on to Kentucky in
1784.</p>
<p>In 1843, three Applegate brothers, Charles, Jesse and Lindsay,
became greatly interested in the far Oregon country and made their
departure from Missouri (Independence). Jesse&rsquo;s experience had
included school teaching, sawmill operation, and an important position
in the Surveyor General&rsquo;s office in St. Louis, Missouri. All
this fitted him admirably for the role of trail blazer, pioneer, and
train leader, which he was to assume.</p>
<p>Those with blooded stock elected Jesse Applegate as Captain of
the now famous &ldquo;Cow Column.&rdquo; He was ably assisted by his brothers
Charles and Lindsay. With the Looneys, Waldos, Nesmiths,
Fords, Kaisers, and Delaneys, they pressed on and in time, assisted
by Dr. Whitman, arrived at the mission in October, 1843. After
leaving Fort Hall, they blazed their own trail&mdash;and finally arrived
safely in the Willamette Valley. They discovered that the powers
in the East refused to give aid to the new settlements because England
held the Columbia and there was no other means of ingress to
the country for soldiers. The Applegate brothers decided they
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
would provide one, and that from the south. They asked Levi Scott,
a brave and trusted man, to lead it. Before the party crossed the
Callapooya it fell out and began straggling back. The Applegate
brothers met and gathered them together as they returned.</p>
<p>Jesse was elected Captain, with Lindsay second in command.
Charles remained at the settlement to look out for several families
of small children and their mothers, as well as to watch the crops
and to be alert for Indian attack. The party left on June 22, 1846,
to locate and open a southern route to the Willamette Valley. They
returned in late October. Over one hundred wagons made this historic
trip.</p>
<p>Jesse served in the Provisional Legislature from 1845 to 1849.
Later he became Indian agent and candidate for the U. S. Senate.
In 1849, he settled in the Umpqua Valley, where Charles also decided
to make his pioneer home. Lindsay settled in what is now
the Ashland area. The Charles Applegate house is one and one-half
miles northeast of the town of Yoncalla, and was completed in
1856. The home faces the south and is surrounded by stately trees.
Many shrubs still bloom in the garden which were planted by Melinda.</p>
<p>The structure is two and a half stories, and the lumber for it was
cut by Washington Cannon of Scotts Valley. Many of the timbers
were hand hewn and the chimney brick were burned on the
grounds. A long veranda, with balcony above, was built under the
overhanging roof. The first floor contained two large rooms with
sizeable fireplaces in the middle, opening into each room, and a
front door opening out onto the long porch. The west room was
formerly known as &ldquo;Grandmamma&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; To the east were the
living room, sewing room, dining room, and kitchen. Each of these
had heavy beamed ceilings. There were, in those early days, small
winding staircases rising in the fireplace corners, and a landing
near the chimney in the center of the house above the staircase. Upstairs
the design was much the same. There were two large rooms,
both opening out onto the balcony. Alongside them and above the
dining room were four small bedrooms with attractive nine-paned
windows.</p>
<p>Fifteen sons and daughters grew up in this historic house.
Uncle Charley&rsquo;s home, being centrally located, was the gathering
place of all the Applegate clan. Today the home is owned by Miss
Eva Applegate, a direct descendant. The home has never been sold
to others in over 105 years.</p>

<p>One of Lane County&rsquo;s most historic, most well preserved, and
architecturally charming houses is that known as the Cartwright
place or Mountain House hotel. It is located on the Old Territorial
Road, three miles south of Lorane, Oregon, and is now the property
of Mr. and Mrs. Eldon Thompson.</p>
<p>It was built in 1853 by Darius B. Cartwright. Dee, as he was
familiarly known, was born near Syracuse, New York, February,
1814. In 1832 he served in the Black Hawk War. Some years later
his family moved to Illinois. Here a brother, Barton, became a
Methodist circuit rider who saw to it that his family had educational
opportunities, one son becoming an early-day judge.</p>
<p>Darius B. Cartwright with his wife and several children left
Illinois for the gold rush in California in 1849. Sometime later they
pressed on to Oregon, remaining for a time near what is now Medford.
In 1853, the family took up 530 acres near what is now Lorane
and called the location Cartwright. Upon this beautiful site
was built the fine home which was also to serve as a stagecoach
inn, the official stop between Portland and San Francisco, a telegraph
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
station and a post office, with Mr. Cartwright as postmaster.
One of the first messages received over these wires during the Civil
War was that of the assassination of President Lincoln.</p>
<p>William Russell had accepted an offer from the Cartwrights to
be their wagon-train driver, for which he was to be paid the considerable
sum of five dollars per month. He was born in Gallia
County, Ohio, in 1827, but later moved to Illinois. Upon reaching
the Cartwright&rsquo;s destination, he went on and settled in Salem, Oregon,
where he married and had three children: Mary, Emma, and
Charles. While the latter was still an infant, his wife died so he and
the family went back to the Cartwright place.</p>
<p>Here, on January 12, 1866, he married D. B. Cartwright&rsquo;s
daughter, Katie. On May 3 of the same year, he purchased the
property from Mr. Cartwright, and the home became known as the
Mountain House hotel. Here two children were born to the Russell&rsquo;s:
Darius B. and Myrtle. Mr. Russell&rsquo;s father-in-law stayed on
as postmaster until his death on July 29, 1875.</p>
<p>Through the years the property changed hands a number of times
until John and Nancy Addison purchased the house and land in
1902. Mr. Addison built the first sawmill in the area, at which time
lumber was selling for six dollars a thousand. It was bought by Mr.
and Mrs. Eldon Thompson in 1952, who are the present occupants.
The house has a lovely setting. It is surrounded by softly rolling
green hills, magnificent trees, and rich bottom soil. The black walnut
trees in front were planted over a century ago, from nuts
brought across the plains. Original flagstones lead up to the old
eight-paneled front door.</p>
<p>The house is of all-wood construction, has two stories, and
classical design. Hand-hewn timbers are used throughout. The
walls consist of irregular-width, hand-split cedar, put together with
square, hand-forged nails. Still visible are sizeable squared-off,
round supporting timbers with bark still attached, which accounts
in part for the fine condition of this 108-year-old structure. The
floors are made of irregular, wide boards throughout the house.
Still remaining are the woodwork, the high ceilings, the sixteen
stairs with cedar balustrade, the nine original twelve-paned windows,
the original wood trim, and the old red-brick fireplace with
mantel, and small cupboards above, the gun closet, and marks of
bullet holes in the baseboards.</p>

<p>The early-day house of Dr. and Mrs. Thomas Condon stands at
1268 Jackson Street near 13th Avenue West. The home, built in the
late seventies, originally stood at the Southwest corner of 11th and
High Streets and was purchased by the Condons in 1882. It is a
two-story house of wood construction with approximately ten
rooms, which include a parlor and a charming living room with an
old brick fireplace and plank walls, 2&times;10 and 2&times;12, set vertically.
In earlier days a low white railing gracefully decorated the top of
the house, which had a mansard roof, the latter also having been
used in early University of Oregon buildings.</p>
<p>On its original site, the house stood on one half of what is now
a city block and was not surrounded by any other buildings. The
Condons planted many fine shrubs and trees, some of which are
still standing at this home&rsquo;s former location. In 1907, Dr. Condon
passed away, and after a time the home was moved to its present
location by Elwin McCornack of Eugene, a grandson.</p>
<p>Thomas Condon, pioneer Geologist of Oregon, was born in
Southern Ireland in 1822 of Norman Irish stock, and the name is
prominent in Ireland&rsquo;s history, especially from the eleventh through
the seventeenth centuries. When young Thomas was eleven years
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
old, his family moved to America, and their first home was in the
wilderness which is now Central Park, near the site of the American
Museum of Natural History in New York City. Here as a boy he
began the study of nature and the flora and fauna of that region.
After completing his education, he spent several years in teaching
and later completed a course in Auburn Theological Seminary in
1852. A few months later, he married Miss Cornelia Holt, a young
teacher of New England ancestry, whose home was near Buffalo,
New York. The young couple decided to go to the Oregon Country
as missionaries, the Home Missionary Board of the Congregational
Church having accepted them for this important endeavor.</p>
<p>After a long voyage around Cape Horn and up the West Coast,
they arrived in Portland, Oregon, and from there went to St. Helens
and later to Albany. After a time the Condons decided to move to
The Dalles. Here they established a church which was open to any
denomination and to all kinds of people in all walks of life. Many
of the latter, inspired by Dr. Condon&rsquo;s avid interest in science, assisted
him in collecting geological data and specimens. Too, at
times he accompanied the U. S. Cavalry of old Fort Dalles, on field
expeditions into the John Day region. Here he collected &ldquo;fossil&rdquo;
material and other data of the utmost importance in the field of
geology and palaeontology, and in turn exchanged this valuable information
with the Smithsonian Institute.</p>
<p>After about ten years, the Condons left The Dalles, going to
Forest Grove, where Dr. Condon taught at the college awhile. In
1876, he was asked to become a member of the first faculty of the
University of Oregon and became head of the Natural Science Department,
later the Department of Geology. In the latter capacity,
he opened up the John Day &ldquo;fossil beds&rdquo; and adjacent regions to
scientists from all over the world; he also contributed much to the
literature in his field, one of his best-known works being his book,
&ldquo;Two Islands.&rdquo; Condon Hall and Condon Museum of Geology on
the University of Oregon campus bear his name, as does also the
chapel in the First Congregational Church of Eugene.</p>
<p>Dr. Condon, a scholarly man and a very fine teacher, possessed
also a fine sense of humor. In addition, he manifested a warm interest
in, and a kind of sympathetic understanding of, the people
with whom he came in contact. The Condons opened their home
to faculty, students, world-famous scientists, ministers, neighbors,
and friends, with true hospitality. Mrs. Condon always shared her
husband&rsquo;s activities.</p>

</div>
<p>The historic house at 170 East 12th was built by Daniel Christian,
III, about 1855. In 1852, a year of great westward emigration,
Daniel Christian, III, his wife, and five children, joined a party of
over 100 wagons headed by Samuel and John Alexander, whose
destination was Oregon. This well-managed train encountered few
real difficulties. It was well supplied with dried fruits, berries,
corn, and flour, while the cows provided milk, cream, and butter.
They escaped the dread cholera and had no trouble with Indians.
However, a young chief, seeing Daniel&rsquo;s pretty daughter, tried to
bargain for her. Fearing that the Indian might steal her, she was
hidden in another wagon until the young brave gave up following
them. Six months after beginning their trek westward, they reached
the Columbia River and proceeded down it by flat boat to The
Dalles. From there they proceeded by primitive railway&mdash;with
wooden rails and mules for power&mdash;and on by steamboat to Portland.
After a short stay, the Christians settled for the winter in
East Tualatin.</p>
<p>The following fall, Daniel III acquired a donation land claim,
160 A, in the Eugene area, later known as the Christian Addition.
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
Here upon a choice spot, a log cabin was built, being replaced two
years later by the frame house.</p>
<p>The eldest grandchild of the Christians, the late Irena Dunn
Williams, handed down to her children&mdash;Mrs. Howard Hall of Eugene
and Mrs. Wallace Hannah of Vancouver, Washington&mdash;many
stories of the happy times spent with her grandparents; memories
of stirring apple butter in an old brass kettle; of eating fresh-baked
bread spread with delicious homemade butter; of popping corn on
winter evenings; and of Bible reading&mdash;for the Christians were devout
Methodists.</p>
<p>It was Daniel III who cut and hand-hewed the lumber for the
First Methodist Church of Eugene. Through the years this pioneer
family has contributed much to the religious, cultural, and educational
life of the community, since that far-off day when Daniel III
came to the Oregon country well over one hundred years ago. The
two-story house rests on a foundation of hand-hewn timbers and is
of all-wood construction, overlapping weather board, being used
throughout. The house and barn both were put together with
wooden pegs.</p>
<p>The downstairs consists of an entry hall with a stairway leading
to the second floor. On the left is the living room, and off that the
dining room, which contains an attractive built-in china closet. Adjacent
to this is a bedroom. Just off the dining room are the kitchen,
a small hallway, and porch, back of which is an old-fashioned
woodshed. Originally, a hall, several bedrooms, and a bath comprised
the upstairs.</p>
<p>In 1947, Mr. and Mrs. L. O. Meisel, the present owners, completely
renovated the pioneer home. The upstairs was converted
into two apartments and the downstairs was all remodeled. During
this process the walls were stripped back to the original eight-inch
wood boards. Pasted on these were old papers dated 1868, over
which cheese cloth and quaint wallpaper had been placed. Old
flues became visible, another reminder of the past.</p>
<p>The front porch still has its old-style weather-boarding and supporting
pillars, and the cornice extends far around the gable ends
of the house. Likewise many of the original small-pane windows
remain. To the rear of this historic home, one may still see Waxen
and Bellflower apple trees, which were on the 160-acre donation
land claim of Daniel Christian, III.</p>

<br /><i>Henrietta Stewart Brown</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="596" />
</div>
<p>Although modern in appearance, this was the first house in
Albany, built by Thomas and Walter Montieth in 1849. The house
was erected on the corner of Second and Washington streets but
since has been moved back from the corner. The house was much
smaller when first built but has been remodeled and enlarged several
times. The most extensive remodeling work was done by
Henry Wolz in 1925. Although remodeled, the original Montieth
house is still embodied in the structure.</p>
<p>In 1845, Abner Hackleman had made his way up the Willamette
Valley and staked out his claim in what is now the east end of the
city of Albany. He had been the captain of a large wagon train that
had come over the Oregon Trail from Iowa. As it was winter when
the group arrived in the Oregon country, most of the emigrants remained
in the lower part of the valley. Abner, however, continued
on up the valley, probably on horseback, with the idea of finding
suitable land on which to found a settlement.</p>
<p>With him on this trip, or joining him shortly afterwards, were
Hiram Smead, Tommy Summerville, and several others, none of
whom settled in the Albany area. Smead was the man who later
sold what is now the business district to the Montieths, when they
arrived in 1847.</p>
<p>Abner erected a temporary shelter and stayed through the winter
of 1845. In the Spring, he arranged to have Hiram Smead &ldquo;hold
down&rdquo; one of his claims for him, and he himself returned to Iowa
to bring the rest of the Hackleman family to the Willamette Valley.
The land-grant law at that time permitted a man to be absent from
his claim for two years while bringing his family from the East.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Albany&rsquo;s first settler, however, was destined never again to see
the area he had claimed, for he died in Iowa the following winter.
Abner&rsquo;s youthful son, Abraham Hackleman, settled his father&rsquo;s
estate in Iowa and brought the family to Albany, arriving in 1847
and taking up his father&rsquo;s donation land claim. In the meantime,
Hiram Smead, precariously holding down a claim to which he had
no title, sold the land to the Montieths for four hundred dollars and
a horse, when he received news of Abner&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1848, Walter and Thomas Montieth, two energetic
young Scotsmen, came into the valley seeking a location. After
viewing the country, they concluded to buy out Mr. Smead. Judging
from the lay of the country&mdash;with its broad prairies reaching
back to the picturesque Cascade Mountains, which suggest unlimited
resources for agriculture, and with its great possibilities in
water power for all kinds of industries offered by the Willamette
and Calapooia rivers&mdash;the young men concluded that this spot was
a very desirable site for a town and that the surrounding country
could soon be made to blossom as the rose. So they at once decided
to file on another claim. They had the land surveyed and that part
adjacent to the river they laid out in town lots. Their first cabin, at
a point now known as Second Avenue and Washington street, soon
was ready for occupancy. They named the new town Albany in
remembrance of their home town in New York.</p>
<p>Early in 1849, they began the erection of the first framehouse
built in Albany. It still stands and is often pointed out as a &ldquo;relic
of bygone days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold excitement in California that summer put a sudden
stop to all building, as the Montieth brothers were among the first
adventurers to catch the gold fever. The building just begun was
finished the next year. It was a two-story structure, and although
it has been remodeled several times, the framework is still sound.</p>
<p>According to information given by Mrs. J. V. Pipe, daughter of
Thomas Montieth, &ldquo;Thomas and Walter Montieth crossed the plains
by wagon train to the Willamette Valley, arriving in the spring of
1847. In 1849 the Montieth brothers built the first frame house in
Albany ... where both families lived. The dividing line of the two
Montieth claims ran through the house, making it possible for the
brothers to live under the same roof, yet each on his own claim.
The dining table was affixed to the floor so each could eat on his
own property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Montieth donated the ground upon which the first
Albany College was built.</p>

</div>
<p>The Reverend Joab Powell was of Quaker descent, born on July
16, 1799, in Claiborne County, Tennessee. He went to Missouri
in 1832, crossed the plains by covered wagon train with his large
family in 1852, and took up an Oregon Donation Land Claim south
of Scio, Oregon. The next Spring he had his farm underway, so
that he, several members of his family, and neighbors built a log
church in a beautiful fir grove on a hilltop on his farm. They named
it Providence Baptist Church, and on that site a larger Providence
Community Church still stands today. He became its pastor, with
Reverend J. G. Berkley as assistant. The Reverend Powell preferred
to hold evangelistic meetings through the territory, while Brother
Berkley stayed at home taking care of Providence Church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The Reverend Powell preached at Good Hope, Washington
Butte, Scio, and Sublimity churches, besides his many seasons of
revivals. At first he would not receive any compensation for his
work except the hospitality of its members, but later he did not refuse
a small salary.</p>
<p>Joab&rsquo;s wife, Ann Beeler Powell, was a small, quiet woman of
German ancestry. She and the older sons ran the farm, while Joab
rode far and near, holding church services in the widely scattered
settlements. He would return each fall to the home on the Santiam
river, ragged and dispirited. His home was a well of strength.
Each night by the fireside, throughout the winter, his wife would
read chapters of the Bible to him. Joab would listen and later repeat
them word for word, by memory. She would refer with pride
to his summer&rsquo;s achievements. Slowly his confidence and courage
would build up; and, in the Spring, he would be ready for new
conquests.</p>
<p>Elder Powell had friends in all walks of life. His adaptability,
no doubt, was one of the underlying reasons for his famed evangelical
success. He was a straight and honorable man, and his preaching
far and near was followed by spiritual awakenings of great
power. His work stood the test of time. He died in 1873 and lies
buried in Providence Churchyard beside his wife. Ann died as she
had lived&mdash;gently&mdash;in the early Spring of 1872. Joab never rode the
circuit again. He died seven months after his wife was gone.</p>
<p>Each third Sunday in June, an all-day service is held at the historic
Providence Church to commemorate the achievement of Elder
Powell and his faithful adherents, and the community&rsquo;s tribute to
a pioneer circuit rider.</p>
<p>In tribute to the pioneer preacher, the late Professor J. B. Horner
of Oregon State University wrote: &ldquo;During his ministry he baptized
nearly 3,000 souls, a greater number than any other person
baptized west of the Rocky Mountains. The Reverend Powell was
illiterate from an academic standpoint, but he was so thoroughly
versed in the Bible that he did not require it for reference in the
pulpit, although his sermons abounded in Biblical quotations. He
understood men and he communed with nature as with a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the late 1840&rsquo;s, missionaries of two branches of the Presbyterian
faith&mdash;the Associate and the Associate Reformed&mdash;arrived in
the Willamette Valley. In July, 1850, Dr. T. S. Kendall organized
the Associate Presbyterian Church in the Oakville neighborhood,
and this is still a strong rural church. In 1851, Wilson Blain arrived
in the valley. He had lived in Oregon City and had been editor of
the &ldquo;Oregon Spectator.&rdquo; He organized a church at Union Point,
near Brownsville, Oregon. Other missionaries followed.</p>
<p>The difficulties of travel and the great distances from church
centers soon caused the question of union to come up, resulting in
a compact being drawn up uniting these bodies into the United
Presbyterian Church of Oregon. Taking part in the Union were Dr.
Kendall, Dr. Irvine, and Rev. J. P. Millar of the associate group.
In the Associate Reformed group were Rev. Blain, Rev. James
Worth, and Rev. Jeremiah Dick. This union took place at the home
of Rev. Blain, October 20, 1852. These two bodies united in Pittsburgh
into the United Presbyterian Church of North America in
1858.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>In October, 1853, the Albany Church was organized, the first to
be organized as the United Presbyterian Church. The Rev. J. P.
Millar was pastor until his death in April, 1854. He was killed by
an explosion of the Steamship &ldquo;Gazelle&rdquo; near Oregon City.</p>
<p>Dr. Irvine, who was pastor at Oakville (Willamette), followed
the Rev. Millar, by giving part time to the Albany Congregation
until 1873. He severed his connection with the Willamette Church,
moving to Albany, where he was pastor until his death in 1895. He
was Moderator of the General Assembly in 1878.</p>
<p>The Albany congregation met in the Courthouse, an octagonal
building which burned in the 1860&rsquo;s. A church was built in 1863
at Fifth and Washington, on ground obtained from Thomas Montieth.
This building served many years, but on June 20, 1891, the
cornerstone of the present church was laid and the church formally
dedicated, August 7, 1892.</p>
<p>The General Assembly met in Albany in 1894, and Dr. Irvine
was able to attend one meeting in a wheelchair. The next pastor
to remain many years was Dr. W. P. White. He came in the fall
of 1901, and was pastor until 1920. In 1906, the Dr. S. G. Irvine
Memorial pipe organ was installed at a cost of over $2,800. It is
still in use.</p>
<p>Again the General Assembly met in Albany in 1952, with commissioners
from all over the United States and the mission fields.
In 1953, the church observed the &ldquo;100th Anniversary&rdquo; of the organizing
of the church. The contractor for building the church was J.
B. Cougill; it cost about $16,500. The architect, who drew the plans
for the present church, was Walter Pugh, of the firm of McCauley
and Wickersham of Salem. The name &ldquo;White Spires&rdquo; was made official
on January 8, 1958.</p>
<p>The spires are outstanding and are the highest points in Albany.
The supports are made of laminated wood. Though swaying badly
during the typhoon of October 12, 1962, it stood, although traffic
was blocked off for hours. The stained-glass windows were not
broken. They are very unusual both in design and coloring. The
White Spires Church still stands and the present pastor is the Rev.
Ralph R. Hawthorne.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boston Mills&rdquo; was a familiar name to early Oregon pioneers. It
was one of the early gristmills. Men would take their wheat by
horseback or in wagons from miles around to this mill and take
home the flour for their families. Boston, like many other settlements,
hoped to be a city and perhaps the county seat.</p>
<p>Eliza Finley Brandon (Mrs. Thomas Brandon), 1850-1948, says:
&ldquo;My father, Richard Chism Finley, built the original mill at the old
town of Boston in 1856-1858. He owned a half interest. Alexander
Brandon and P. V. Crawford each owned one-fourth interest. It
was destroyed by fire. With the flour-mill there was a carding factory.
There a fire was kept burning all the time to warm the wool
as it was worked. The fire probably started from this. Soon after
the fire, the mill was rebuilt. All the massive timbers for both mills
were cut out and hewed by hand in the woods near Crawfordsville,
and hauled to Boston&mdash;an immense task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There used to be fairs at Boston in the early days&mdash;not really in
Boston but in the country to the east across the Calapooya, at the
foot of a small hill between Saddle Butte and the Calapooya River.
This hill was called Bunker Hill because it was near Boston, and
one time two settlers had a fight there over a land claim, &ldquo;The
Battle of Bunker Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Pioneers relate that Boston once had a post office, established
September 22, 1868, two stores, and a blacksmith shop, in addition
to the mills. When the railroad passed one and a half miles to the
west, Boston failed to develop as a town, and Shedd became the
railroad station.</p>
<p>Mr. E. D. Farwell, pioneer, says the ownership of the mill ran
like this: Finley, Crawford and Brandon; Finley &amp; William (Billy)
Simmons; Simmons Brothers; Simmons and Knoll; Simmons &amp;
Thompson, then Thompson, the present owner.</p>
<p>We are told that the old timbers, mentioned earlier, remain in
the present reconstructed structure, and that the old millstones lie
under the water of the millrace. The white walls of the present
mill are reflected in the clear waters of the millrace, the busy
wheels continue to hum, and flour is ground for descendants of the
pioneers of early days. The well-kept home of Mr. Otto Thompson,
the present owner, stands nearby, only a short distance from the
home of &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Simmons, the miller of earlier days.</p>

<p>Oregon pioneers must have had a diverting time clearing the
land, planting orchards, tilling fields, and erecting homes. Doing
all the planning called for constructive creation and real achievement.
However, I wonder whether the one who moves into a
ready-made house doesn&rsquo;t have even more thrills and flights of imagination.
I consider myself a fortunate mortal to dwell in a place
with an interesting historical background. I was fascinated by the
Oregon farm that my father and mother bought, near Albany.</p>
<p>My early childhood was spent in the sandhills of Nebraska, a
land characterized by tumbleweeds, prairie fires, and hot winds.
Until I arrived in the Willamette Valley, I had never seen a lilac or
a rose in full bloom. I shall always remember my first glimpse of
the new Oregon home. On that Spring morning, no sky had ever
been so blue, no fields so green, no fruit trees so pink and white.</p>
<p>The house with its high ceiling, grained woodwork, and flower
conservatory aroused my greatest curiosity. How excited I was
after several weeks&rsquo; sojourn to discover a tiny cellar that had escaped
unnoticed! It had been the special location of a barometer
and other instruments for official weather records.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The farm was a part of the Cline donation land claim of the
1860&rsquo;s. In 1887, Mr. and Mrs. John Briggs bought ten acres of this
tract, cleared the land, erected buildings, planted trees, and established
a rose and shrub nursery. In 1902, fifteen years later, when
Mr. Briggs began to fail in health, the farm was sold to J. L. Howard;
and, in 1906, it was sold to Nels Savage.</p>
<p>My father purchased the farm in 1908. For fifty-four years it
has been called The Chase Orchards, but older residents still refer
to it as the Old Briggs Place. Old Mr. Briggs was a dyed-in-the-wool
Britisher. Everything he planted was English to the extreme:
English box, English laurel, English holly, English hedges&mdash;all
fashioned in precise rows, circles, and squares.</p>
<p>If Mr. Briggs could see his old home now, he would find many
changes. The little pines, firs, and cedars are giant in size, real
patriarchs of the forest. English ivy covers the farm buildings, and
the box hedges are broad and rambling. The nursery stock forms
a rose-garden lawn with panels of the same old-fashioned roses
that were planted seventy-five years ago. Filbert, walnut, and holly
orchards have replaced some of the original trees.</p>
<p>In those early days, there were two entrances: a large gate for
the carriage, and a small picket gate leading to a narrow walk between
the hedge and the driveway. At another corner, near the
farm buildings, was a secondary entrance designed for farm vehicles
and delivery wagons. Woe to the misguided laborer who, inadvertently
blundered through the wrong gateway!</p>
<p>Much of our knowledge of the early activities was gained from
Mr. Briggs&rsquo; widow, who lived only a short distance from us. From
her we acquired a floral language of technical titles for trees,
shrubs, bulbs, and flowers. We ourselves made a special contribution
to the time-honored Pacific Coast flora by adding a cutting
from the rosebush that our Great-grandfather Chase had brought
to New York State, a century and a half ago. We are not pioneers.
We are not Webfoots. We are not Oregon mossbacks. We cannot
claim relationship to a native son or a native daughter. We simply
adopted a friendly Oregon community, which is still animated by
the courage and industry of former beauty-loving Oregonians.</p>

<p>The account of perhaps the first instruction given in Albany,
dates back to the 1840&rsquo;s. Since there were not enough children in
the community for organization of a school, it cannot be classed as
one. Mrs. Abraham Hackleman gathered a few small children into
her home, a log house which stood in Hackleman&rsquo;s Grove, and
taught them reading, writing and numbers.</p>
<p>The following incident illustrates the very busy life of these
pioneers: When it came time for the geese to be picked, Mrs.
Hackleman did not want to neglect the children, so the geese were
brought in, and the picking went on with as little interference with
spelling and writing as possible.</p>
<p>The first school was situated in the west part of town, not far
from the cemetery, and was taught (1851) by Dr. Reuben Cohman
Hill. Dr. Hill was a practicing physician and a Baptist minister. In
1850, he crossed the plains to California on the back of a mule and
soon after came to Albany, where he taught the first school before
returning east for his family. Soon after this, Andrew J. Babb conducted
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
a subscription school in one small room near the location of
Takenah Park. During the Civil War, feeling ran so high that the
school was divided. One subscription school, the Republican, stood
where the Methodist Church was on Third and Ellsworth streets;
and the other, known as the Dixie School, Democratic, was located
on the southwest corner of Second and Montgomery streets.</p>
<p>A daughter of Oregon pioneers, Miss Lottie E. Morgan has said:
&ldquo;In Albany, Takenah Park has been officially marked as a part of the
Pioneer Oregon Trail, and it eventually became the site of Albany&rsquo;s
first Central School. One who attended the first Central School, in
1866, tells that it was a one-room building, some thirty by fifty feet
in size, standing in the block known as Takenah Park. Soon after
this date, two ells were added, forming a T-shaped building, where
more teachers, perhaps three, and more pupils were accommodated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Zella M. Burkhart contributed the following, copied from
a manuscript by J. J. Davis, who came to Linn County with his
parents in 1847, and attended the first school taught in Linn County
in 1848: &ldquo;Mr. Anderson Cox, having several children, built a school
house on his place that summer and hired a teacher, Robert Huston,
for a term of three months. He was the first teacher in Linn County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the 1880&rsquo;s, Albany had three schools. The Central School at
Takenah Park has four rooms and four teachers and took care of
pupils beginning with the advanced section of the third grade. Dr.
Oliver K. Beers was one of the teachers at Madson, which was then
a one-room building. There were sixty pupils in five classes of the
first, second, and lower level of the third grades. The Maple School
did the same grade of work. The schools at this time were free,
being supported by taxation. Albany Collegiate Institute at this
time had a preparatory department for those in the upper grades.
Because some people had not yet outgrown the idea that free
schools were for paupers only, there arose again two rival groups
among the young people, known as College &ldquo;Bummers&rdquo; and the
District &ldquo;Scrubs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Linn County, Oregon, is a mountain and river-valley region, extending
from east to west from the summit of the Cascade Mountains
to the Willamette River. The Santiam River and the Calapooya
River, tributaries of the Willamette River, which have their
sources in the Cascades, traverse the valley at approximately the
county&rsquo;s northern and southern boundaries.</p>
<p>In mounds south of Albany have been found human skeletons,
and utensils and weapons of possibly Indian manufacture, pointing
to the custom of burying with the dead, the weapons and implements
used in life. This indicates that Linn County was a happy
hunting ground for a large tribe of Indians known as the Calapooya
tribe, which gave this name to the river flowing into the Willamette
River at Albany.</p>
<p>Earliest settlements were made in Linn County at Albany,
Brownsville, and Lebanon, in the Spring of 1846, by pioneers who
had crossed the plains the year before and had wintered near Oregon
City. The first cabin was erected in 1845 by William Packwood,
where the old Indian trail, between Scio and Lebanon, crossed
Crabtree Creek. It was sold to John Crabtree in the Summer of
1846. The Earl family were the first permanent settlers. They built
a cabin about two miles east of Knox Butte in the Spring of 1846,
and in the same year settlers located at Brownsville and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Brownsville was the county seat then. The schoolhouse on the
Spalding donation land claim in South Brownsville was the first

courthouse. Organization of county government occurred December
11, 1849. Albany was designated as the county seat of Linn
County by legislature in January, 1851; and, in 1852, a courthouse
was erected.</p>
<p>Linn county&rsquo;s second courthouse, erected in 1852, was identical
in plan with the famed Octagon House. The Octagon courthouse
cost nearly $5,000. This wood-frame building, located on West
Fourth Avenue, Albany, burned to the ground September 1, 1861.
The fire did not destroy the county records in use at the time, as
they were protected by a fireproof vault. However, many records
and historical documents from the early days of Albany and Linn
County were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The Courthouse, pictured here, was completed between 1862
and 1865, at a cost of $35,000. The architecture was similar to
Southern Colonial. It had a brick portico and four large Corinthian
columns, two stories high. In 1899, the third story and the clock
tower were added to the original building.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, the town that didn&rsquo;t possess a large
town clock, with chimes, was not a town worthy of mention. Accordingly,
the courthouse addition was designed around the clock
tower. The clock itself had four ten-foot faces and was kept in
motion by 1,000-pound weights. The bells, which rang Albany
people to work in the morning and sounded curfew at night, could
be heard in Sodaville when the wind was right. The clock was
made by the Seth Thomas Company and kept nearly perfect time
throughout its lifetime.</p>
<p>Not only was this courthouse interesting from a material standpoint
but also for its outstanding usefulness to the whole community.
In addition to housing the courtroom and county offices, it
often served as a town hall, meetings of various kinds being held in
the courtroom or in the attic above the second floor. In these same
rooms, many eminent lecturers, evangelists, and other visiting
speakers drew appreciative audiences of town and country folks.
Some of the county&rsquo;s able lawyers made their first speeches there.
Directly to the north of the courthouse lay a vacant block which,
in those early days, was called the &ldquo;Courthouse Square.&rdquo; Also, closely
associated with the courthouse was the square, two-storied brick
jail which stood on the southeast corner of the block. It was erected
in 1871 at a cost of $9,550. When the second courthouse was enlarged
and remodeled, the addition of a third story, two towers, a
town clock, a statue of justice, and other adornments changed the
style and appearance of the building completely, and the old courthouse
became only a memory to those who had loved it.</p>
